# Weather At The Office

## Setting the Stage
Examples of plain HTML and CSS styling. Open `index.html` using a browser to follow along.
## The Documents are _In_ The Computer & Hey, This Looks Familiar!
Enhancing our HTML and CSS with a custom element written in JS. To follow along, first:
-  [Install node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, for hot reload magic, either:
-  Use npm to install `live-server` and run it in the same directory as the `index.html` file:
```
npm install -g live-server
cd weather-at-the-office
live-server
```
or:
- Use a live-server plugin for VSCode or your editor of choice.
